# Weather-Exploration-and-Vacation-Planning
## Description
In this project, I'm tasked with answering the question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?". In the first part (part 1) of the project, I've created a Python script to visualise the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. Using citipy Python library and OpenWeatherMap API, I've created a representative model of weather across cities. In the second part of the project, I use the weather data from part 1 to plan future vacations.
## Usage
Please navigate to the WeatherPy folder for the code for WeatherPy (part 1) and VacationPy (part  2). 
Please navigate to the output folder for a cities data csv file and 4 other png files of scatterplots generated in part 1 of the project.
